Transfer statement:
------------------- 
Transfering the control from one place to another then we should go for transfer statement
break: break loop condition then we should go for break.
example: 
for i in range(10):
	print(i)
Now what it will give the output 0 to 9 but now requirement is when the i value is 7 needs to stop (break loop execuation)

for i in range (10):
	if i == 7 :
	     print('Pocessing is enough just break')
	     break  
    print(i)  ---------here means that if 'i' is not seven simply print the i value .
