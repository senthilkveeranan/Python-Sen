14 Dadatypes in Python :
init 
float
complex
bool 
str 

bytes
bytearray
range
list
tuble
set
frozenset
dict 
None

init:
The main purpose of int datatype is to represent integral value , without decimal point, is consider as int datatype
	
When we talk about int datatype we need to just know about four type of data that is 
1.decimal - all values init 
2.binary -2 
3.Octal - 8
4.hexa decimal - 16 

bin()
oct()
hex()

Float:
complex:
10+20j === These type of data is consider as complex numbre (Electical engineering applications or mathamatical application its usefull)
Here 10 is real part 
and 20j is the imaginary part 
 in both real and imaginary part we can take int value or float value which is acceptable bellow are the examples
 like 10+5.5j
 10.5+20.6j
 20.6j+ 10  all are acceptable
0B1111+10.5j
10+0B1111j  === real part we need to take any format like binary,octal,hexa like that but imaginary part compulsary Only decimal part 









20-Class:
Transfer statement:
------------------- 
Transfering the control from one place to another then we should go for transfer statement
break: break loop condition then we should go for break.
example: 
for i in range(10):
	print(i)
Now what it will give the output 0 to 9 but now requirement is when the i value is 7 needs to stop (break loop execuation)

for i in range (10):
	if i == 7 :
	     print('Pocessing is enough just break')
	     break  
    print(i)  ---------here means that if 'i' is not seven simply print the i value .
