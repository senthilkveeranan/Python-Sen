14 Dadatypes in Python :
init 
float
complex
bool 
str 

bytes
bytearray
range
list
tuble
set
frozenset
dict 
None

init:
The main purpose of int datatype is to represent integral value , without decimal point, is consider as int datatype
	
6-Class:
-------
int==> Without having decimal point is called "int" type , how large it is no worries
float==> Noumber with decimal point is consider as float(doller,desiel price)
bool==>True / False are only allowd values
complex==> 10+20j is complex numbers
str==> Any sequance of charector with in single or doucble quote is called "str"
driple quotes are allowd where-> to define multiline leterals
to use single qoutes and double quotes as symbol then we can use triple quotes

in python how you can access of the charector of the string?
python supports 
+ve index--0,1,2,3, 
-ve index ---1,-2,-3

slice operator:
slice operator is applicable only in python 
slice means pice 
slice always going to consider bgin and end-1 
slice operator never through error

20-Class:
Transfer statement:
------------------- 
Transfering the control from one place to another then we should go for transfer statement
break: break loop condition then we should go for break.
example: 
for i in range(10):
	print(i)
Now what it will give the output 0 to 9 but now requirement is when the i value is 7 needs to stop (break loop execuation)

for i in range (10):
	if i == 7 :
	     print('Pocessing is enough just break')
	     break  
    print(i)  ---------here means that if 'i' is not seven simply print the i value .   	
	
When we talk about int datatype we need to just know about four type of data that is 
1.decimal - all values init 
2.binary -2 
3.Octal - 8
4.hexa decimal - 16
